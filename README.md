# Python-Experiments

This repository contains the initial code I created when learning to use GitHub as part of *DSCI 8133: Foundations of Data Science* at Mississippi State University in fall 2024.

---

## Plan
Future plans for this repository include adding a sample data file and a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebook that will interact with the file.

## About Me
I am Christa Winkler, and I work as an Assistant Professor in Higher Education Leadership at Mississippi State University. My research interests, which align with my emerging interest in **data science**, include:

- Measurement and assessment of college student success outcomes
- Applications of latent variable modeling in higher education
- Emerging trends in quantitative educational research and training

In order to test the inclusion of a photograph, below is a photo from the Cliffs of Moher Ireland, which was taken on my smartphone while attending a European higher education conference in summer 2024.
